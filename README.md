# CancerTree-Decision-Tree-Classifier-for-Breast-Cancer-Diagnosis
CancerTree is a Python-based machine learning project that uses a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the presence of breast cancer based on the popular Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The project also explores model complexity by evaluating tree depth and performs hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
